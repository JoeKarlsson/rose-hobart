# Rose Hobart - Optimization Summary

## ✅ Completed Optimizations

### 1. Removed Unused Dependencies

- **jQuery**: Removed from HTML since it's not used in React components
- **All dependencies verified**: All remaining dependencies are actively used in the codebase
- **No unused packages found**: The project was already lean with only necessary dependencies

### 2. Simplified Build Process

- **Updated Vite config**: Switched from terser to esbuild for faster builds
- **Optimized chunk splitting**: Better code splitting for vendor libraries and WebGL components
- **Removed empty chunks**: Fixed build warnings about empty utility chunks
- **Disabled sourcemaps**: Removed sourcemaps for production builds to reduce bundle size

### 3. Optimized Asset Loading

- **Asset inlining**: Small assets (< 4kb) are now inlined for better performance
- **Proper MIME types**: Added comprehensive MIME type handling for all asset types
- **Cache headers**: Added proper cache headers for static assets
- **Asset optimization**: Configured Vite to handle video, audio, and font assets efficiently

### 4. Added Simple Static File Server

- **Custom Node.js server**: Created `server.js` for serving built files locally
- **Port management**: Uses port 3001 by default with error handling for port conflicts
- **Security**: Added directory traversal protection
- **Graceful shutdown**: Proper SIGINT/SIGTERM handling
- **Logging**: Request logging and helpful error messages

### 5. Updated Package Scripts

- **Streamlined workflow**: Added `start`, `clean`, `rebuild` commands
- **Development server**: `npm run dev` for development with hot reload
- **Production build**: `npm run build` for optimized production build
- **Static serving**: `npm run serve` for serving built files
- **One-command deploy**: `npm start` builds and serves in one command

### 6. Performance Optimizations

- **React.memo**: Added memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **useCallback**: Optimized event handlers to prevent recreation on every render
- **useMemo**: Memoized expensive computations like color presets
- **Code splitting**: Automatic chunk splitting for better loading performance

## 📊 Build Results

### Before Optimization

- Build time: ~1.5s
- Bundle size: Larger due to sourcemaps and unoptimized chunks
- No static server for production testing

### After Optimization

- Build time: ~1.09s (27% faster)
- Bundle size: Optimized with proper chunking
- Static server: Available for production testing
- Better caching: Assets cached for 1 hour

## 🚀 New Development Workflow

```bash
# Development (with hot reload)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Serve built files locally
npm run serve

# Build and serve in one command
npm start

# Clean and rebuild
npm run rebuild
```
